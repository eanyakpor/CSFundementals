# Introduction to Linear Systems 

- Goal 
    1. Systems of linear equations 
    2. SOlving System with 2 equations and 2 unknowns 
    3. linear systems 
    4. basic ooperations in linear system solutions 
    5. No solution, Infinetly many solutions, no solutions 

- Two equations and two unknowns 
    ```
    2x + y = 1 
    -x - 2y = 1 
    ```
    1. subsitution 
    2. elimination 
    3. graphing 
- Interpolation
    - Calculate a, b, c so that the graph of the polynomial f(t) = a + bt + ct^2 goes through the specified points 
- Inifint many Solutions 
    - When any number chosen for the variable, x, determines a value for y and a value for z which solve the original system 
- No Solution 
   - 0 = number 

# Matrices and Gauss Jordan Elimnation 

- Square Matrix 
    - if n == m 

- Types of Matrices 
    1. Diagonal: if all the entries below the main diagnol are 0
    2. Upper triangular: if all the entries below the main diagnol are 0
    3.  if all entries below the main diagnol are 0

- Column and Row Vectors
    - Vector
        - A matrix with one column 

    - Row Vector 
        - a matrix with only one row 

    - Augmented matrix vs coefficient matrix 
        - Aug matrix has a vertical seperator for clarity 

    - Matrices in reduced row-echelon form 
        1. Any zero row is below a nonzero row 
        2. leading entry of any nonzero row is 1 
        3. Every entry above and below a leading entry is 0 
        4. The leading entry of any nonzero row is to the left of any nonzero entry of any row below 

# 1.3 On The Solutions of Linear Systems 

- No Solution 
    - 0x + 0y + 0z = 1 

- Infinitely many solutions
    - [x y z] variable y is a free variable 

- One Solution 
    - x = 3, y = 5, z = 7

- Properties of rank 
    - number of solutions vs. number of unknowns 
        - if a linear system has exactly one solution, then there must be at least as many equation as there are variables m <= n

- Dot product of vectors 
    - The dot product of two vectors and entries is the scalar 

- Linear combinations 
    - A vector is a linear combinations of the vectors if all real numbers there exist scalars
