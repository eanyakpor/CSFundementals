# Introduction to Linear Systems 

- Goal 
    1. Systems of linear equations 
    2. SOlving System with 2 equations and 2 unknowns 
    3. linear systems 
    4. basic ooperations in linear system solutions 
    5. No solution, Infinetly many solutions, no solutions 

- Two equations and two unknowns 
    ```
    2x + y = 1 
    -x - 2y = 1 
    ```
    1. subsitution 
    2. elimination 
    3. graphing 
- Interpolation
