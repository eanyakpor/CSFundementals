**Chapter 2 set Theory**

- Set: an unordered collection of elements 
    - example of set builder notation 
    - C = {X / X is odd positive integer less than 10}
    - D = {X ∈ Z+ / X is odd and X < 10}

- Types of primitive types 
    1. N: nautral numbers 
    2. Z: Integers 
    3. Z+: Positive Integers 
    4. Q: Rational numbers  
        - franctions, integers, positive, negative integers and not 0
    5. /Q: set of irrational numbers 
        - There is no repeating pattern after decimal point
    - data type: type is the name of the set 
- notations 
    - iff: if and only if 
    - empty set: { } or phi 
    - singleton set: {a}

- Theorems 
    1. For every set S empty set is a subset of S and S is a subset of S 
        - |S|: n is the number of elements in the set 
    2. Powerset: P(S) is the set of all subsets of S 
    3. Cartesian Product: It is the ordered n-tuples 
- 2.2: Set Operations 
    1. Union (U): A U B = { X / X ∈ A v X ∈ B }
    2. Insertion (∩): A ∩ B = {X / X ∈ A ^ X ∈ B }  
    3.  Difference (A-B): {X / X ∈ A ^ X /∈ B}
    4. bar notation A = { X / X /∈ A}
