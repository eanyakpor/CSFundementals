# Computer Basics 

| number | Binary |
|--------|--------|
|   1    |   1    |
|   2    |   10   |
|   3    |   11   |
|   4    |   100  |
|   5    |   101  |
|   6    |   011  |
|   7    |   111  |
|   8    |   1000 |

- problem solving is just taking an input and getting an output under constraints defined by the problem 
- Computer's use binary instead of base-1/unary which is how humans count numbers 
- Binary: is in base 2 
- 8 bits are 1 byte 
- ASCII: American Standard Code for Information Interchange 
- Optimized version is Unicode 

# Programming in C 

- source code: code programmer writes 
- Computer's only understand binary then machine code 
- Because of compilers don't have to code in machine code 
- Integer overflow: when you use more bits then avaliable so it overflows 

# Memory 

- Hexidecimal is used to represent a version of RGB, red,green and blue. 
    - when you more digits than 1 - 9 start to use the alphabet
